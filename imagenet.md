Brewing ImageNet with Caffe
===========================

    "All your braincells are belong to us."

Well, hope you liked the geeky quote! We are going to describe a reference implementation for the approach first proposed by Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton in their [NIPS 2012 paper](http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips25/NIPS2012_0534.pdf). Since training the whole model takes quite some time and energy, we also provide a model, trained in the same way as we describe here, to help fight global warming. If you would like to simply use the pretrained model, check out the [Pretrained ImageNet](imagenet_pretrained.html) page.
