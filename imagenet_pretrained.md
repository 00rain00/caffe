Running Pretrained ImageNet: the Easy way
=========================================

For easier use of pretrained models, we provide a wrapper specifically written for the case of ImageNet, so one can take an image and directly compute features or predictions from them. Both Python and Matlab wrappers are provided. We will describe the use of the Python wrapper here, and the Matlab wrapper usage is very similar.

We assume that you have successfully compiled Caffe and set the correct `PYTHONPATH`. If not, please refer to the [installation instructions](installation.html).
